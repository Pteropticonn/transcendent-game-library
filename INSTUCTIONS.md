/*
  THE PROJECT - PART 1
  --------------------

  OBJECTIVE:
    A project demonstrating your capabilities in creating
    an application that contains routing, authentication,
    asset handling, associative collections, and the
    fundamentals of MVC.

  TASKS:
    The following files must be repaired/completed:
    - /app.js  🗹
    - /routes.js 🗹
    - /controllers/SessionsController.js 🗹
    - /controllers/UsersController.js 🗹
    - /controllers/ResourcesController.js 🗹
    - /models/User.js  🗹
    - /models/Resource.js 🗹
    - /views/resources/index.js 🗹
    - /views/resources/show.js 🗹
    - /views/resources/new.js 🗹
    - /views/resources/edit.js 🗹
    - /views/resources/_form.js 🗹
    - /routes/resources.js 🗹

  GOAL:
    Create an application that utilizes the User as an
    associative part to another resource. You are not
    limited to creating one resource. Make the app
    interesting. Some ideas for apps are:
    - Books (where User's are the authors)
    - Reservations (where User's are the applicants)
    - Collections (where User's are the collectors)
    - Games (where User's are the players)

    Have fun with this. Bonus marks are rewarded to those
    who think outside the box and create an interesting app.

  NOTE:
    YOU MUST USE THE FILES PROVIDED!
    If you have an idea for an application that invokes the
    practices of authentication, associations, MVC, and routing
    utilizing NodeJS, but doesn't follow the format of the course,
    I want a proposal outlining what functionality the application
    will have and the architecture you'll be using explaining
    how the application is MVC, what it's using for routing,
    authenticating, and associations, and why you couldn't use the
    provided starting application.
